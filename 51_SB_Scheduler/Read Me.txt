What is Spring Boot Scheduling?
=> Spring Boot Scheduling help us to schedule tasks for execution at a given time period
=> We have to use below 2 annotations to make use of Spring boot scheduling 
@EnableScheduling
@Scheduled

Different types of Scheduling:
FixedRate:
=> the job at a fixed time period between invocations
=>  It does not wait for the previous task to be complete

FixedDelay:
=> Execute the job at a fixed time period between the end of the previous invocation and the start of the next invocation
=> It basically waits for the previous task to be complete

Cron:
=> Execute the job as per cron-expression to include triggers on the second, minute, hour, day of the month, month, and day of the week

Cron Expression:
Cron Expression format:
<Seconds> <minutes> <hours> <day-of-month> <month> <day-of-week> <year>
Character	Meaning	Example
*	All. Represents that the schedule should run for every time unit	A “*” in the minute field indicates that the schedule runs every minute
?	Any. Represents any arbitrary value. This can be used only in day-of-month and day-of-week fields	A “?” in day-of-month field will not use the day-of-month for deciding the schedule as any value is acceptable here
-	Range. Represents a continuous range of values.	Using “5-8” in the <hour> field indicates the hours 5, 6,7 and 10
.	Multiple Values. Separates a list of different values	Using “5,6,10” in the <hour> field indicates the hours 5, 6 and 10
/	Increment. Specifies the amount by which to increment the values of a field	3/5 in the minute field indicates the minutes 9, 8, 13, .. 58 in an hour. */10 in the minute field indicates the minutes 0, 10, 20, …60
